# coffeeshop

This is a my first experience on building a Django Web application where I explore during my semester break in March 2023.

The Web App basically show a list of cafe that can be submit if you are a registered user and see the reviews of each cafe listed .User also have the chance to 
rate and review the cafe .

User can submit their application to add a new list of cafe to the web app and admin will filtered whether the submission are legit or reject if its not.

Here are a demo video for the web app consisting normal user aniq and admin.
